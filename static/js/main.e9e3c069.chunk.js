This is an optional step in the Data Entry process but can     be helpful.',"Part QTY":"Line numbers compose the Workscope column in MXI under which    the Tasks are sorted by default, from least to greatest. It is a simple    sequential numbering system from 1 to the number of tasks in the Work Order.    To aid in locating the correct task, RTS Specialists will usually label the    Line Number that a task is on, placing the corresponding number next to the    task on the actual vendor document.","Part Description":"Vendor Line Numbers follow the order in which the    Discrepancies or Tasks are laid out in the actual vendor paperwork. These    will not necessarily match up with regular Line Numbers, except coincidentally.    Vendor Line Numbers compose the second column under the Workscope tab in MXI.    Part of our job is to ensure that every Task in MXI has its corresponding    Vendor Line Number in Maintinex.","Part Number":"This is the name of the Task and will typically match the name of    the corresponding Task on the actual Vendor Document. This is one of several    ways to ensure you are typing the data under the correct task in MXI.        \n\n The other methods of finding the corresponding Task is to match the     Vendor Line Number for the Task or locate it via the Line Number written next     to the Task on the actual Vendor Document.","Part Serial Number":"The ID, or Task Barcode, is a Barcode specific to the     corresponding Task in the same row.  These are unique to every task across every    Work Order and will differ from the Work Order Barcode as well.     \n\n Searching in MXI with this Task Barcode will bring you to this specific task.
